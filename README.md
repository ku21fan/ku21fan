Regarding the [deep-text-recognition-benchmark](https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark) repository, after moving from NAVER Clova to the University of Tokyo in 2020, I stopped managing it.
Fortunately, most issues are already answered in GitHub issues.
If you cannot find the answer, ask me via email.
However, I cannot answer the questions related to the Clova OCR service.
